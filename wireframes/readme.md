# Understanding wireframe
What is a wireframe? Wireframe is a visual representation that shows how an app or web screen is set. It can be hand-drawn and then digitized.  For example, UX designer thinks through how a login screen in app should be designed and start drawing a wireframe. 

Both app and web requires a wireframe to smoothly reflect what fundamental elements the app/web screen needs. Also, wireframe helps to understand better how your project is structured - from front end to back end. 

See below YouTube video and wireframe example for further details.

## Meow Canvas wireframes
Below wireframes have been drawn with the help of [Diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) after watching above YouTube tutorial. Meow canvas is a visually focused service since its main focus is showing and comparing cat drawings from users. Thus, in mobile main screen, sections are horizontally divided with canvas contents. In app login screen, sub-sections for password recovery and Oauth are additionally placed at bottom. In the case of web, most of the NFT marketplaces have adopted bidding system in deciding an artwork price. The service should be able to focus and list its characteristics - title, description, which blockchain it is connected to, price, and so on. The artwork's thumnail is firstly displayed and then others follow. In web login screen, the cat's paw in a canvas is adopted as UI element so that users may feel that they have become an artist in an entertaining way.  i
